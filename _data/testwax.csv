The inside cover features useful measurements and calculations that may be necessary for both everyday and obscure purposes, including a multiplication table and the Troy weight system used primarily for precious metal measurements. Sections of the book are dated out of order, indicating she went back possibly due to lack of paper as it was quite expensive. The paper is likely made of cotton and linen rags, both common materials in the 18th century for papermaking. Although the relatively high number of papermills in England (430 by 1800), the process of making paper was still done by hand at this point, which led to steep prices and its relative luxury status. By the late eighteenth century, writing was still a skill more reserved for the upper classes yet was important for the social education of gentlemen. The eighteenth century was marked by an increase in women learning the skill for household duties and a matter of formality, often learning through private tutors or relatives. Sharaf un-Nisa likely was taught by either or both a writing instructor and her children. This is also likely considering the frequently different handwriting used in the first line of many pages. Cursive was the standard writing practice at the time so Sharaf un-Nisa would have been taught to write cursive only. There are multiple mentions of people both within her life and general English society. She early writes her daughter’s name Harriet out several times, as well as using her married surname. There’s a reference to a “Lady Glyn” who’s the “Duchess of Puddle Dock.” Puddle Dock is a neighborhood in London and one of the poorer regions of the city during the 18th century. Glyn is the surname of an up-and-coming banking family and later influential descendants in the 1800s. This could possibly be referring to the wife of one of these bankers, or a quip at the differences between the family’s apparent wealth and the poverty found in this slum. She also names King George III, the reigning monarch at her time. There’s also mention by name of a Christopher Mason, who served as Rear Admiral of the White for the English. He may have been a household name, or possibly she had known him personally. There’s mention of a name Owen Cadwallader followed by the name of a ship from 1794, the Prince of Wales. He may have been a captain or another important crew member on board. There’s also a Cadwallader Owen who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries that played an important role as clergyman in Great Britain. The names Mrs Biddele and Monsieur Dupuy l’Algebria, who may be close associates of hers. There are also a few geographic locations, including several in Italy (Verona, Venice, and Placentia), Westminster Abbey, and several continents. The repetition of sayings and phrases on each page signifies these as common phrases of the day or maybe taken from a writing teaching guide.""","""Scan outside covers, inside covers, front and back of all folios, including blank pages.""",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHhRMTasCxavoYer89Wn8_Xn65nL0sW0/view?usp=sharing,,dml0001-dml0100,0,testwax,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/item1_a/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/item1_a/full/1140,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/item1/manifest.json

An essential oil captures the 'essence' of a plant's fragrance and typically captured via distillation. The production of rose oil originated in Persia, and the oil is priced high due to its intensive production and low output. The process of distilling and extracting oils from flowers began with the Persian Muslim scholar Ibn Sina, and this process later spread to Europe where the first real perfumes were manufactured. Perfume became widely used during Elizabeth I's reign, during which she required public places to be sprayed with perfume to remove foul odors. However, it still remained more prevalent in the aristocracy or upper classes, and was a necessary accessory for upper class women. Whereas many bottles at the time were created in Chinoiserie style, it appears this was created via enameling.

Both sard and carnelian had been used  for Persian seals because the stone does not stick to hot wax. These were generally regarded as talismans, or objects regarded to have magical powers. During the Regency era, most sealing wax, typically colored red or black for the public, did not include any wax, instead incorporating ingredients such as powdered chalk or gypsum and vermilion. Long, thick sticks of sealing wax would be placed above a fire to be pressed down by a seal such as this one. Whereas many other seals featured a family crest, this stamp included a reference to Mustafa, an alternate name of the prophet Muhammad meaning ""chosen.""
