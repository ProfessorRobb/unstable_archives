additional_info: '"The penmanship book was sold by a Shirley Woolmer, who also served
  as printer for the Exeter Gazette or one of the main newspapers in Devonshire. The
  inside cover features useful measurements and calculations that may be necessary
  for both everyday and obscure purposes, including a multiplication table and the
  Troy weight system used primarily for precious metal measurements. Sections of the
  book are dated out of order, indicating she went back possibly due to lack of paper
  as it was quite expensive. The paper is likely made of cotton and linen rags, both
  common materials in the 18th century for papermaking. Although the relatively high
  number of papermills in England (430 by 1800), the process of making paper was still
  done by hand at this point, which led to steep prices and its relative luxury status.
  By the late eighteenth century, writing was still a skill more reserved for the
  upper classes yet was important for the social education of gentlemen. The eighteenth
  century was marked by an increase in women learning the skill for household duties
  and a matter of formality, often learning through private tutors or relatives. Sharaf
  un-Nisa likely was taught by either or both a writing instructor and her children.
  This is also likely considering the frequently different handwriting used in the
  first line of many pages. Cursive was the standard writing practice at the time
  so Sharaf un-Nisa would have been taught to write cursive only. There are multiple
  mentions of people both within her life and general English society. She early writes
  her daughter’s name Harriet out several times, as well as using her married surname.
  There’s a reference to a “Lady Glyn” who’s the “Duchess of Puddle Dock.” Puddle
  Dock is a neighborhood in London and one of the poorer regions of the city during
  the 18th century. Glyn is the surname of an up-and-coming banking family and later
  influential descendants in the 1800s. This could possibly be referring to the wife
  of one of these bankers, or a quip at the differences between the family’s apparent
  wealth and the poverty found in this slum. She also names King George III, the reigning
  monarch at her time. There’s also mention by name of a Christopher Mason, who served
  as Rear Admiral of the White for the English. He may have been a household name,
  or possibly she had known him personally. There’s mention of a name Owen Cadwallader
  followed by the name of a ship from 1794, the Prince of Wales. He may have been
  a captain or another important crew member on board. There’s also a Cadwallader
  Owen who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries that played an important role as clergyman
  in Great Britain. The names Mrs Biddele and Monsieur Dupuy l’Algebria, who may be
  close associates of hers. There are also a few geographic locations, including several
  in Italy (Verona, Venice, and Placentia), Westminster Abbey, and several continents.
  The repetition of sayings and phrases on each page signifies these as common phrases
  of the day or maybe taken from a writing teaching guide."'
