additional_info: 'The owners of the collection mentioned a few possible names of who
  this miniature painting might belong to – Samuel Shelley, for instance. John Bogle
  was also working at the same time. Samuel Shelley was involved in the founding of
  the Watercolor Society, which may be able to provide some guidance about the provenance
  of this painting and some clarity about its being a signature painting of Shelley’s.
  The following page shows a list of paintings by Shelley previously auctioned off:
  http://www.artnet.com/artists/samuel-shelley/past-auction-results. Similarities
  in features such as the nose and eyes between this painting of Sharaf un-Nisa and
  Shelley''s works indicate a strong chance this was one of his works. Note that the
  case in which it has come was not original but has been added to increase the protection
  to the painting. The matron cap and high collar of the dress she''s wearing suggest
  adherence to societal norms of female modesty. Pearls have been farmed for centuries
  in Great Britain from freshwater mussels; however, today the practice is virtually
  banned across the nation. During the 18th century many regions experienced shortages
  in pearls, allowing only the wealthy to obtain real pearls.'
notes_digitizer: Remove the painting from its protective frame and photograph top
  and bottom of miniature painting without the glass. Please be very careful, as this
  painting is very fragile, and return to the protective frame once it has been photographed.
