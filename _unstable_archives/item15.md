summary: This is an addressed and sealed letter from Janab Muhammad Khouram Tarah
  Panah or Muhammad Khouram Utar Panah
contents: "15A) This is an envelope with the seal that says Janab Muhammad Khouram
  Tarah Panah or Muhammad Khouram Utar Panah. There is nothing in the envelope and
  it is hard to know which, of any, of the letters in this collection it belongs to.
  The address of the envelope has a benediction in Persian asking Allah to protect
  the letter until it reaches Gerard Gustavus’s homeland. It addresses Gerard Gustavus
  in very elaborate terms, a few phrases of which are translated below. \n\n15B) There
  is also a blank piece of paper. Interestingly, neither of these pieces of paper
  seem to have chainlines, indicating that this paper was made by some other method.
  \n\n“May Allah protect this envelope to the homeland.” [Inayattalah envelope homeland]
  \ “God of bounty, pole of governance.” [Khudaavand-i na’amat – god of bounty; Khutb-ud-daulah
  – pole of governance]; “from Azimabad” [Az maqam-i Azimabad].” This means Patnah."
