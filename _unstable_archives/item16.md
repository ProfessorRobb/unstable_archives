  16A) An envelope with a relatively large and grandiose seal that belonged to Moin ud-Daula Khan Miyār ul-Mulk Muhammad Raza Khan. The envelope is addressed to Ducarel using the elaborate appellations that include “God of bounty, pole of governance.” [Khudaavand-i na’amat – god of bounty; Khutb-ud-daulah – pole of governance].” میار معین الدولہ خان الملک میر محمد رصا خان بہادر مطفز جنگ (Miyar Moin ud-Daulah Khan ul-Mulk Mir Raza Khan Muhammad Bahadur Jang]

  16B) Inside is a crisply burnished letter that has been decorated with flecks of gold; this was a very elaborate and expensive letter indeed. Chain lines are visible. The letter is extremely affectionate and friendly, mentioning the desire to hear news of Ducarel. It also mentions that the writer is in regular contact with John Shore. One particularly poignant section: “This sincere friend will have eyes on the road and hands in prayer that this friend is delivered by God to his destination, that place.”
