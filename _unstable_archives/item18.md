summary:
contents: This is a single page, burnished and with a very little gold dust sprinkled
  on the paper. There must also have been silver dusted onto the page which has since
  tarnished, explaining the otherwise dusty appearance. This letter seems to be the
  first part of a longer letter; there is no signature. This one has not yet been
  translated.
