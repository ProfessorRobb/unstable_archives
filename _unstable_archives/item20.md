summary:
contents: 'An abject letter from one of Sharaf un-Nissaâ€™s brothers talking about his
  many woes and troubles. It is possible that this letter belongs to the envelope
  addressed to John Shore mentioned under Item 19, since both men are mentioned here.
  The letter ends by asking for Ducarel to send regards to his children. The paper
  is burnished with light gold dusting.
