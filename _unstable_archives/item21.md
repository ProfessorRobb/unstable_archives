summary:
contents: "21 A: Envelope addressed to Mr. Ducarel in Exmouth, Devonshire. Mix of
  Persian and English script. The seal is that of ‘Alim Beg\n\n21 B: A massive letter!
  The paper has chain lines but is not burnished or flecked at all. The letter is
  written by Sharaf un-Nissa’s brother ‘Alim Beg and mentions another brother, Daim
  Beg. The letter spells out in very dire terms the financial straits of the family
  and makes clear that the family has holdings in Purnea, as well as links across
  the region. It also mentions John Shore. Note that the paper is not burnished AT
  ALL, perhaps a signifier of the urgency of the family’s financial straits. "
