  The envelope is sealed by Daim Beg, with his seal printed in ink rather than with
  wax. The envelope and letter are stored together in the Palmer collection, but they
  may or may not have been delivered together. Alternatively, the packet sealed by
  Daim Beg could have included multiple letters, including the letter signed by ''Ali
  Beg in this archival unit.
