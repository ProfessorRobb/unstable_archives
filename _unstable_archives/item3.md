additional_info: The box is made of tortoise shell and ivory on a wooden base. The
  family cannot prove that this belongs to Elizabeth Sharaf un-Nisa since there are
  many Elizabeths in the family, but the combination of family history and the dating
  of the jewelry box as a popular style in the Regency period seems to make it likely.
  As it sounds, the material comes from the shell of large species of turtles and
  tortoise; tortoise farming for this purpose has been banned since that time. Used
  since ancient times in places like Greece and East Asia, a Frenchman named Andre
  Charles Boulle, a cabinet maker for Louis XIV, started a trend of applying tortoiseshell
  on wooden or metal objects for display.
notes_digitizer: 'Photograph the outside of the box and the inside of the box and
  the bottom of the box. '
