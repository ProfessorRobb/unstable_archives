summary:
contents: "Letter on unburnished paper in Persian. It is unclear who wrote the letter,
  but it seems apparent that it was one of the brothers, most likely Allum Beg because
  he is not listed in the very detailed sign-off at the end of the letter. This letter
  is useful because it lists everyone in Sharaf un-Nisaâ€™s family. This letter also
  seems to start in midstream, as there is no formal greeting and the letter begins
  uncharacteristically right at the top of the page. \n"
