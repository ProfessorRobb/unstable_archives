_date: 35A) The date is given as '1195 Bangla,' corresponding to 1788 in the Gregorian
  calendar. The date is given as the 27th of the month but the name of the month is
  unclear. 35B) The seal gives the year 1198, but given that people did not always
  update their seal every year, this only dates the envelope to sometime after that
  date .
place_origin: 35A) The envelope says it was sent from Calcutta.
