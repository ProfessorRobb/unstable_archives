additional_info: Elizabeth, or Baby Foulkes, is G.G. Ducarel's grandaughter, borne
  to his daughter Elizabeth (Betsy) and her husband Archibald Foulkes. William, Mary,
  and Philip are also G.G. Ducarel's children. Jenny and Haddy may be nicknames for
  his two other children, Jane and Harriet. In his letter, Ducarel assures that his
  ship has "nothing to fear from the French." At this time, the French Revolutionary
  Wars were pitting France against Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, the Holy Roman
  Empire, and other European monarchies.
