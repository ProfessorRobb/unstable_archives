dimensions: Philip Ducarel, son to Gerard Gustavus Ducarel and Elizabeth Sharaf un-Nisa,
  was a landowner, businessman, magistrate, and poet. Portrait miniatures were popular
  among the wealthy British elite, as well as soldiers and sailors who wished to give
  their loved ones a token to remember them by. Watercolor and ivory were popular
  mediums in the early 18th century because ivory's luminosity and watercolor's layering
  ability lent well to rendering skin tones.
